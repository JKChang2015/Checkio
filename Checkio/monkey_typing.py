# Description: You are given some text potentially including sensible words. You should count how many words are
# included in the given text. A word should be whole and may be a part of other word. Text letter case does not matter.
# Words are given in lowercase and don't repeat. If a word appears several times in the text, it should be counted only
# once.
#
# For example, text - "How aresjfhdskfhskd you?", words - ("how", "are", "you", "hello"). The result will be 3.
# Input: Two arguments. A text as a string (unicode for py2) and words as a set of strings (unicode for py2).
# Output: The number of words in the text as an integer.

    match = set([x for x in words if x in text.lower()])
